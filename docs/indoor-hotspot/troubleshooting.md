# Indoor Hotspot Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble with setting up your hotspot or got a query?, the following tips may help.

### No lights are turning on:

You should see the lower light on the back of the unit turn on as soon as power is applied.
If this is NOT the case, ensure the power supply is firmly plugged into the wall outlet, the power jack is plugged into the unit and that the wall outlet is switched on.

Only the lower light will turn on to begin with until the unit is running.

### My hotspot is not showing in the Helium App:

It can sometimes take 1 minute from power on for the Hotspot to show in the App, simply re-scanning a few times can then find the hotspot.

Ensure Bluetooth is turned on as this is how the application communicates with your Hotspot.

You will have had to have granted location permissions for the Application to access Bluetooth services correctly.

### My unit is not detecting Wi-Fi networks:

You may find that sometimes your Wi-Fi network may not show in the application if the signal is poor where the Hotspot is located.
